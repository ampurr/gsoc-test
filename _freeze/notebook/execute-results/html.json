The [answer is no](https://community.rstudio.com/t/how-to-run-quarto-qmd-from-within-package/154711/2).\n  + Looked up why `pkgdown` [adds the `docs/` directory into `.gitignore`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69507610/unable-to-push-package-website-pkgdown-from-r-to-github). But it's still unclear to me.\n  + Noticed that the intro to `pkgdown` page [accidentally uses the word \"setting\" twice in a row](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown.html).\n- Learned more about git:\n  + Learned of `gitk`, which I've never used before.\n  + Learned about [managing my git credentials in `usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html).\n- Looked up some tips on how to write code comments better. Tips from: [Antonin Januska](https://web.archive.org/web/20201111223912/https://antjanus.com/blog/web-design-tips/best-comment-separator/) and [Ellen Spertus](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/12/23/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments/).\n- Learned that the string `GITHUB_PAT` can be found in the `.github/workflows` directory.\n- Learned about documentation managers. There's: [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/) and [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/).\n- Learned that there are, like, eight test suites. And they automatically run when you make a pull request to the `animint2` repository. That's nice. I'm also learning that the tests take a long time to run---about 45 minutes.\n- Turns out that `ripgrep-all` doesn't look through YAML files. I need something like `yq` instead. Why?\n\n### Created\n\n- Created `README.md` from the `README.org` file via the magic of `pandoc`.\n- Created a preliminary website and documented how I generated it:\n  + For the documentation and code, see `website_setup.Rmd`. Currently have information about building the website.\n  + Put the site up online.\n- Accidentally made a pull request in `tdhock/animint2`. Should've been `ampurr/animint2` instead. I closed it---be more careful.\n- Made a pull request in `ampurr/animint2` but did not initially succeed in closing it due to a test failing. Later, I pushed it anyway, which then threw the website online.\n- Successfully set up the website. But there are some errors. Most noticeably: it includes some functions that don't seem to be part of `animint2`. Will need to investigate further.\n\n### Confused\n\nOne of the tests---\"Test Suite compiler\"---failed. Here's the error message:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n══ Failed tests ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n── Error ('test-compiler-gist.R:4:3'): animint2gist() returns an object of class 'gist' ──\nError: Error: In non-interactive environments, please set GITHUB_PAT env to a GitHub access token (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use)\nBacktrace:\n    ▆\n 1. └─animint2::animint2gist(list(p = qplot(1:10)), browse = FALSE) at test-compiler-gist.R:4:2\n 2.   └─gistr::gist_create(...)\n 3.     ├─gistr:::gist_POST(...)\n 4.     │ └─gistr:::cVERB(...)\n 5.     │   └─crul::HttpClient$new(url, headers = c(auth, headers), opts = list(...))\n 6.     │     └─crul (local) initialize(...)\n 7.     └─gistr::gist_auth()\n\n[ FAIL 1 | WARN 0 | SKIP 5 | PASS 756 ]\nError: Error: Test failures\nExecution halted\nError: Process completed with exit code 1.\n```\n:::\n\nThis is confusing, since I thought `GITHUB_PAT` was already set with a GitHub Access Token. I was also unaware of the large array of tests that activate when you try to push something. Quite frankly, I'm not sure what they do or what they prevent. It feels different than using `testthat`.\n\nI also don't understand the GitHub workflow stuff. What exactly is GitHub doing?\n\n\n## Week 2 (June 5 to June 11)\n\n### Learned\n\n- Learned that the [`roxygen2` package](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) generates both the `.Rd` files and the `DESCRIPTION` for packages.\n- Learned that `devtools` has so so so many dependencies. The [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/r-devtools) does, anyway.\n- This is real basic, but I re-learned that `bash foo.sh` runs shell scripts. I haven't run one since September of 2022.\n\n### Created\n\n- Well... Technically it's the opposite of creation. I deleted the `fortify.foo` files in the `R/` directory.\n<!-- - Made a pull request to resolve [issue 89](https://github.com/tdhock/animint2/issues/89):\n  + Well... Technically it's the opposite of creation. I deleted the `fortify.foo` files in the `R/` directory.\n  + Then I ran `build.sh` to rebuild the `DESCRIPTION` and got rid of the unnecessary `fortify.foo.Rd` files. -->\n\n### Confused\n\n- `yay -S r-plyr r-reshape2` isn't working and requires \"manual intervention.\" Why?\n",
